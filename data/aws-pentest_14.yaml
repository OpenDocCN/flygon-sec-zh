    issues if not executed correctly. When pentesting AWS, it's crucial to understand
    what you as a pentester can and cannot perform on an AWS system. These types of
    attacks bring systems down during a pentest and ruin your reputation, while also
    potentially destroying client systems and creating substantial revenue loss for
    both the pentesting company and the targeted client.

    a firewall solution to help mitigate these attacks. AWS provides a service called

    techniques that create baselines within the environment that are based on usual
    traffic, and it will report anything that deviates from that traffic. Additionally,
    it will also perform real-time mitigations on common and more frequent attacks,

    times can even be very dangerous if your team doesn't fully understand what is
    within the scope of the pentest, and can lead to fines or even actions that would
    be considered illegal under the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act** (**CFAA**). Depending
    on who and what the pentest team is testing, you could also be breaking other
    laws, such as federal and state laws; however, that would depend on each pentest.

    stay out of any legal conflict during a pentest. The get-out-of-jail-free card
    is essentially a piece of paper stating that a pentest team is authorized to pentest
    the target organization – however, it should also annotate **WHAT**, **WHERE**,
    and **WHEN** the pentest team is allowed to pentest. This is extremely important
    because pentesters may not be able to pentest during certain times due to high-value
    traffic times; they also may not be authorized for some pentest regions of the
    network or web applications hosted within the AWS environment.

  zh: 这是确保在渗透测试期间避免任何法律冲突的最重要的基本因素之一。免于监狱的牌本质上是一张纸，说明渗透测试团队被授权对目标组织进行渗透测试 - 但是，它还应该注明渗透测试团队被允许进行渗透测试的“什么”，“在哪里”，和“何时”。这非常重要，因为由于高价值流量时间，渗透测试人员可能无法在某些时间进行渗透测试；他们也可能未经授权进行网络或托管在AWS环境中的Web应用程序的某些渗透测试区域。
- en: Before the target organization gives out the get-out-of-jail-free cards to the
    pentest team, there needs to be a clear understanding of the scope. If something

    of a production or live system that would have massive revenue loss if it went
    down. The pentest team and the client organization must create an emergency response
    plan in the unfortunate case that an outage does occur. Additionally, there should

    of high-volume testing to test against the reliability and durability of their
    systems, networks, and products. In this case, often customers may want to ensure
    that web servers hosted on an EC2 instance can withstand large amounts of traffic.
    Stress testing, which can also at times be called load testing, or gameplay testing,
    can also ensure that if traffic becomes too much for the web server, the traffic
    is then redirected by a load balancer. For a high-level view of load balancing,
    please refer to *Figure 11.4*.
